          <p class="text-center text-dark" style="font-size: 16px;">"PRAYAS is the extension initiative of Gopali Youth Welfare Society.

                <h3>Our Motivation</h3>
            </header>
            <p class="text-center text-dark" style="font-size: 16px;">Back in 2014, our founder <b>Mr. Mrinal Kanti Bhanja</b> realized that the people who achieved their dreams are not giving back to the society. He identified two reasons behind this feeble social participation of people:
Firstly, people are under the chains of their financial insecurities. They think that doing social work will not allow them to make their living and hence they lack motivation and passion to bring a change.

            <p class="text-center text-dark" style="font-size: 16px;">
            <span id="read-more-content">
            <br>
            <br>
            Secondly, even if some are motivated they lack a platform and proper guidance and a team of like-minded people to execute their ideas to solve social problems.
            Through this initiative, we want to motivate people to join us and find out ways to develop an area using the locally available resources.<button onclick="changeContent()" id="about-read-less">..read less</button></span></p>

          As stewards of GOPALI YOUTH WELFARE SOCIETY, the board and staff of Society are committed to adhering as closely as possible to his intentions, as reflected in our guiding principle. GYWS is a rural-based registered
  organization by and for the people. Despite the many ups and downs, it has pulled on with real favor to serve the disadvantaged, the underprivileged, the poor and the needy. Our journey would not have been smooth if it was
  not for the support by the wholehearted participation and cooperation from the community as well as from the other partners (agencies) have helped a lot to sustain the activities. So, we take this occasion to extend our

					Gopali Youth Welfare Society has acted as a prime example of how involving the youth of the country into social work can not only help us solve the nation's social problem but also help us provide life-skills to the members involved. I personally am a product of this platform, and closely understands how providing a platform can change someone's life.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px">
					We at LiGHT are working very hard to deliver a similar platform to the future leaders of the country to come forward and carve the path to the Nation's Development. We are trying to achieve this by explicitly providing them with the skills required to solve these problems followed by an opportunity to get a flavor of social problem-solving at the grass-root level by getting involved with our initiatives or identify their own and work for it.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px">
					Our aim is to form a network of student-run centers like ours across the country so that whenever any student has an amazing idea about solving a problem, he or she should know exactly how to execute those.

                        large amount needed to effect change. There are people all over who are concerned about the
                        situation
                        and who
                        want to do something to change it. However, their own commitments and pressures do not allow
                        them to
                        go
                        out
                        and directly work with situation. LiGHT provides them the opportunity to help in whatever
                        way they
                        can.
                        They
                        can contribute their money, materials, time, or skills. When everybody comes together and
                        pitches
                        in, no
                        task
                        is impossible. This COLLECTIVE ACTION has an impact and brings about change. Every
                        individual’s
                        contribution
                        is important. This is the fundamental principle on which LiGHT functions.
